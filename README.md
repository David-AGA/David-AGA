- 👋 Hi, I’m @David-AGA Director of Abilities Group Australia
- 👀 I’m interested in building a VR AI learning platform to assist people to learn how to work with people that have disabilities
- 🌱 I’m currently learning or trying to learn how to use this platform and how to hopefully write code to a level where I can find a community that will assist to make this dream come true
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to code and build a training structure that is ready for web 3 and hopefully find investers to support the growth of the platform
- 📫 How to reach me at david@abilitiesaus.com.au
